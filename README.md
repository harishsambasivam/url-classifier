# URL Classifier using 1D CNN

Phish Recon is a URL classifier which use `1D CNN` for classification. We converted `keras model` to `tensorflowJS model` and predicting the URL in browser itself using tensorFlowJS.
Previously we tried some machine learning techniques [click here for code](https://github.com/harishsambasivam/url-classifier/tree/master/flask(random%20forest%20classifier)) and decided to use 1D CNN based on classification metrices.

Our special thanks of gratitude to our project guide `Ms.T.Veni Priya M.tech.,ph.D` who gave us the golden opportunity to do this wonderful project on the topic (URL Classifier), which also helped me in doing a lot of Research and we came to know about so many new things.
